  <h3><b> Space studies and research on the outer space has always intrigued man. Mankind has a thirst to know what is beyond the earth’s atmosphere. Thus every nation has set up its own space agencies and research centres. They are numerous of them but only few are the ones who are of high quality, do extreme research, are technologically advanced and are well known around the world.

    <h2>NASA</h2>
    <p>The National Aeronautics and Space Administration or NASA, United States, no doubt holds the first position. It was established in October 1958 and has been involved in high profile space programmes since then. Project Apollo was the first exploration mission to the moon held by NASA. Currently NASA is engaged in a number of missions which study climate changes, freshwater resources, mystery behind the development of Sun, and life on other planets and so on. What Does NASA Do?
      Many people know something about NASA’s work. But most probably have no idea about how many different things the agency does. Astronauts in orbit conduct scientific research. Satellites help scientists learn more about Earth. Space probes study the solar system and beyond. New developments improve air travel and other aspects of flight. NASA is also beginning a new program to send humans to explore the Moon and Mars. In addition to those major missions, NASA does many other things. The agency shares what it learns so that its information can make life better for people worldwide. For example, companies can use NASA discoveries to create new spinoff products.
      
      NASA helps teachers prepare students who will be the engineers, scientists, astronauts and other NASA workers of the future. They will be the adventurers who will continue exploration of the solar system and universe. NASA has a tradition of investing in programs and activities that inspire students, educators, families and communities in the excitement and discovery of exploration. NASA offers training to help teachers learn new ways to teach science, technology, engineering and mathematics. The agency also involves students in NASA missions to help them get excited about learning.</p>

    <h2>RFSA–Russian Federation Space Agency</h2>
    <p>RFSA is one of the partners of the ISS or the international Space station. It is one of the leading agencies actively engaged in development of space vehicles, launchers and ground based infrastructure. Founded prior to NASA in 1922, it suffered financial problems in the initial years but later managed to launch many successful missions. The State Space Corporation "Roscosmos" (Russian: Государственная корпорация по космической деятельности «Роскосмос»), commonly known simply as Roscosmos (Russian: Роскосмос), is a state corporation of the Russian Federation responsible for space flights, cosmonautics programs, and aerospace research.

      Originating from the Soviet space program founded in the 1950s, Roscosmos emerged following the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991. It initially began as the Russian Space Agency, which was established on 25 February 1992 and restructured in 1999 and 2004, as the Russian Aviation and Space Agency and the Federal Space Agency (Roscosmos), respectively. In 2015, the Federal Space Agency (Roscosmos) was merged with the United Rocket and Space Corporation, a government corporation, to re-nationalize the Russian space industry, leading to Roscosmos in its current form.
      
      Roscosmos is headquartered in Moscow, with its main Mission Control Center in the nearby city of Korolyov, and the Yuri Gagarin Cosmonaut Training Center located in Star City in Moscow Oblast. Its launch facilities include Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan, the world's first and largest spaceport, and Vostochny Cosmodrome, which is being built in the Russian Far East in Amur Oblast. Its director since May 2018 is Dmitry Rogozin.
      
      As the main successor to the Soviet space program, Roscosmos' legacy includes the world's first satellite, first human spaceflight, and first space station (Salyut). Its current activities include the International Space Station, wherein it is a major partner. On 22 February 2019, Roscosmos announced the construction of its new headquarters in Moscow, the National Space Centre. Its Astronaut Corps is the first in the world's history.</p>

    <h2>ISRO–Indian Space Research Organisation</h2>
    <p>The ISRO became the first Asian Space agencies to reach the orbit of Mars. It is the world’s first agency to have achieved this mission on the very first attempt. Formed in 1969, ISRO has lanuched75 spacecrafts till date. It designs, manufactures satellites and launches programmes and space missions. The Indian Space Research Organisation is the national space agency of India, headquartered in Bengaluru. It operates under the Department of Space (DOS) which is directly overseen by the Prime Minister of India, while Chairman of ISRO acts as executive of DOS as well. ISRO is the primary agency in India to perform tasks related to space based applications, space exploration and development of related technologies. It is one of six government space agencies in the world which possess full launch capabilities, deploy cryogenic engines, launch extraterrestrial missions and operate large fleets of artificial satellites.

      The Indian National Committee for Space Research (INCOSPAR) was established by Jawaharlal Nehru under the Department of Atomic Energy (DAE) in 1962, on the urging of scientist Vikram Sarabhai recognising the need in space research. INCOSPAR grew and became ISRO in 1969, within DAE. In 1972, the Government of India had set up a Space Commission and the Department of Space (DOS), bringing ISRO under the DOS. The establishment of ISRO thus institutionalised space research activities in India.It since then has been managed by the DOS, which governs various other institutions in India in domain of astronomy and space technology.
      
      ISRO built India's first satellite, Aryabhata, which was launched by the Soviet Union on 19 April 1975. In 1980, ISRO launched satellite RS-1 onboard its own SLV-3 making India the sixth country to be capable of undertaking orbital launches. SLV-3 was followed by ASLV which was subsequently succeeded by development of many medium-lift launch vehicles, rocket engines, satellite systems and networks enabling agency to launch hundreds of domestic and foreign satellites and various deep space missions for space exploration.
      
      ISRO has the world's largest constellation of remote-sensing satellites and operates the two satellite navigation systems GAGAN and NAVIC. It has sent two missions to the Moon and one to Mars.

    <h2>ESA–European Space Agency</h2>
    <p>ESA are one of the best in launching vehicles for space orbits. It was established in 1975 by ten member states. It now constitutes 22 member states. Together the nations handle space programmes far behind the reach of just a single nation. The European Space Agency (ESA; French: Agence spatiale européenne pronunciation, ASE; German: Europäische Weltraumorganisation) is an intergovernmental organisation of 22 member states dedicated to the exploration of space. Established in 1975 and headquartered in Paris, ESA has a worldwide staff of about 2,200 in 2018 and an annual budget of about €7.2 billion in 2022.

      ESA's space flight programme includes human spaceflight (mainly through participation in the International Space Station program); the launch and operation of unmanned exploration missions to other planets and the Moon; Earth observation, science and telecommunication; designing launch vehicles; and maintaining a major spaceport, the Guiana Space Centre at Kourou, French Guiana. The main European launch vehicle Ariane 5 is operated through Arianespace with ESA sharing in the costs of launching and further developing this launch vehicle. The agency is also working with NASA to manufacture the Orion spacecraft service module that will fly on the Space Launch System. Members include Austria, Belgium, the Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom. Slovenia is an associate member. Cooperative agreements have been signed by various countries, including Canada (1981), which participate in some ESA projects. Headquarters of the agency are in Paris. ESA has cooperated with the U.S. National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) on many projects and, on its own, was responsible for the Giotto space probe, which enabled examination of the core of Halley’s Comet in 1986. ESA also developed the Ulysses spacecraft (launched 1990) to explore the Sun’s polar regions and the Ariane series of launch vehicles, and it established a system of meteorological satellites known as Meteosat. At the beginning of the 21st century, ESA launched the Mars Express orbiter and its lander, Beagle 2. With the launching of the Columbus laboratory on the International Space Station in 2008, ESA became a full partner in the operation of the station. In 2009 ESA launched Planck, a satellite that is designed to study the cosmic microwave background, and Herschel, an infrared observatory that is the largest telescope in space.</p>
